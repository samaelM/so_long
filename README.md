# so_long

Hey!! this is my version of the project so_long from school 42. It's nothing incredible but it should work (I hope).

## How to install

### in one line

```bash
$> gcl https://github.com/samaelM/so_long || gcl https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux so_long/mlx
```

### step by step

you first need to download this repo :

```bash
$> gcl https://github.com/samaelM/so_long
```

then enter the directory

```bash
$> cd so_long
```

and finally you need to install the mlx

```bash
$> gcl https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux mlx
```

## ENJOY!

create the executable with :

```bash
$> make
```

execute like this (maps are stored in ./maps/ and you can easily create more):

```bash
$> ./so_long [map]
```

move with w,a,s,d and catch all the stars!
